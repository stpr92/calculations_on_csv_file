I have created a CSV file which includes 7 different people's grades (grades between 0 to 20).

In this project I have wrote a python program which includes 5 functions to fulfilled following 5 tasks :

1- Calculate the average score of each person and store it along with their name. The order of the output names should exactly match the order in the input file.
2-Store the averages along with each individual's name in ascending order.
3-Store the top three averages along with each person's name.
4-Store the three lowest averages without each person's name.
5-Calculate and store the average of the averages.

** in order to import and read the csv file and use it in function and call the function I used an small trick.
